  bio: [
    "I’m not just another BCA student with a “passion for tech.” I don’t chase certificates or copy-paste projects. I build systems from scratch, break what doesn’t work, automate the chaos, and then rebuild it stronger.",
    "I’ve worked on real, functional projects, not just class submissions. From building UHI Care, an open healthcare platform with AI-powered automation, real-time doctor-patient video interaction, and structured data syncing — to crafting MediBot, a wellness assistant that delivers everything from Ayurvedic remedies to fitness routines, booking appointments, setting up reminders, and streamlining user health journeys.",
    "I even threw myself into side gigs for fun — building a Rajasthan tourism site just to explore creative design and user flow, and later developing TechGear, a full-stack e-commerce platform with a secure admin portal, inventory and stock management, order control, and real-time client-side ordering.",
    "React. Node.js. Supabase. Automation. n8n. APIs.",
    "I don’t “explore” tools — I deploy them. I focus on building systems that work when I’m not watching. Because for me, this isn’t a portfolio. It’s a living ecosystem of shipped ideas.",
    "Right now, I’m a novice in the internship world — but not in delivery. I’m actively looking to work with startups or product-focused teams where I can learn fast, solve problems, and contribute from Day 1. I bring energy, speed, accountability — and I build with intent.",
    "If it’s simple, I scale it.",
    "If it’s complex, I simplify it.",
    "And if it looks impossible — I’m already in the code."
