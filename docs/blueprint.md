## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark purple (#301934) to give a professional and sophisticated aesthetic appropriate for a portfolio.
- Background color: Almost black (#121212), providing contrast, ensuring readability, and creating a sleek, modern feel.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080), this will draw attention to important interactive elements, making the website more dynamic and engaging.
- Font pairing: 'Roboto' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Open Sans' (sans-serif) for body text to maintain a clean, readable, and modern design.
- Use a clean and modern layout with a clear visual hierarchy. Prioritize readability with sufficient whitespace and a comfortable line length for text. Optimize for dark mode with high contrast.
- Employ a set of consistent and professional icons, where applicable, to visually represent skills, technologies, or services offered. Icons should complement the overall aesthetic and enhance usability, ensuring they are visible and legible on a dark background.
- Incorporate subtle, non-distracting animations for transitions and interactive elements. For example, a smooth fade-in effect when loading sections or a gentle highlight on hover for links and buttons, ensuring animations are optimized for performance in dark mode.
